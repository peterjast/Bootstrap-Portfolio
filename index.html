              <p> I’m Peter Staker and I’m a Full Stack Web Developer located in Seattle, Wa. I’m driven, hard-working and I thrive under pressure. I’m always eager to learn and develop my skills. I possess an acute sense of detail and a high aptitude for problem solving. Through the development of my professional portfolio and completion of the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp, I believe that my unrivaled work ethic, ability to learn on the fly and meticulous attention to detail make me the ideal addition to any team. </p>
            <p>
                I studied philosophy at the University of Washington and although it was intellectually and morally satisfying, it didn’t provide me with very many career options. I followed in the footsteps of many great philosophy majors and began my career as a bartender. This led me to Hawaii, where I spent time working on a cruise ship. The job was the closest thing to slavery that the law allows, but I made some great friends along the way and got to fulfill a lifelong dream of exploring and experiencing the Hawaiian Islands. Like many other mainlanders that begin a new life in Hawaii, I became homesick. I quit my job, took a few weeks of personal time to enjoy the island life and then came back to the place I call home.</p>

          <p>I’ve been back in the Pacific Northwest for the last three years and although bartending can be a fun and rewarding profession, the time to start a new chapter in my life is now. I crave change and knowledge and coding has proved to be a challenging new endeavor that constantly keeps me on my toes. The languages of computers are constantly evolving and I look forward to the consistent pursuit of knowledge and mastery that this field provides. My background in philosophy provides me a with the thirst for knowledge and logical way of thinking that is necessary to succeed in this industry.            
        </p>  
        <p> When one decides to view the world as a classroom and humanity as a teacher, the potential for personal growth and the acquisition of knowledge becomes infinite. While studying Philosophy, it became clear to me that the only thing I can be certain of is the unknown. No matter how much I believe I know about any given subject, I’ve only scratched the surface of my potential understanding.</p>
